# Production Problem 04: Implementing HCI Guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, Android/Google, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment. Use this to kickstart your work on Project 2.

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).
Focus on touch-related elements.

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:

* Android:

* Windows Desktop Guidelines:

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guidline One (URL):https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
 This guideline states that a web designer should "use visual weight
 and balance to convey importance" when designing for ios devices. When I
 visit the my.iit.edu website on my iphone, the login area is tiny and 
 not very noticable when in portrait mode. I recall visiting this website for
 the first time to login and not liking how small it was. I implement this 
 guideline in my sketch by slightly elongating the box containing the login
 text fields and slightly enlarge the text / text boxes. This adds visual 
 weight to the login area, and makes it stand out much more to an iphone user.
 This enlargment of the login area would need to be subtle in order to 
 maintain balance with the rest of the page. I think the login deserves a 
 little more emphasis than it is currently given.

* HCI Guidline Two (URL):https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/visual-design/adaptivity-and-layout/
* How you implemented it in your sketch: The second guideline states that a
 designer should "extend visual elements to fill the screen". This is a 
 perfect time to scrutinize the login box again. The my.iit.edu webpage
 does not take advantage of all available screen space as the guidline 
 states. On the left portion of the screen, there is a large blank space 
 below the login, support, policies, and student go boxes. I think this is 
 a good opportunity to extend the length of the login box so that it utilizes 
 the remaining screen space. By extending the length of the login box on the
 left side of the page, there is more room to enlarge the login elements and
 draw attention to this area of the page.

* HCI Guidline Three (URL):https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/visual-design/terminology/
* How you implemented it in your sketch: The third guideline states "Keep interface text clear and concise".
 The my.iit.edu page does not follow this. I think that much of the text (especially in the social media section)
 is excessive. For example, they offer a large paragraph of reasons to follow them on social media that nobody
 will ever read. This takes up space that could be used to make the page look nicer. I would shorten this entire 
 section to read "Stay connected with the IIT community!" and shrink the image size. This would allow for the
 help section to be higher / more visible on the page (Which is believe is more important that a large block of text
 about social media).
