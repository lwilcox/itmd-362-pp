Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette
(you’ll see that the uid value in the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make).
Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=13-0u0kfkvU5LRKa-H9jJrjo9nc
Your Rationale: I felt like this monochromatic color palette would be a good fit for a website
		introducing a new gaming system because it's simple, clean, and the blue color is
		welcoming / not distracting. I think the light blue color scheme is a good balance
		between fun and professional. A user that would be visiting a site for a new gaming
		console probably wouldn't want the site to be too bland looking but also wouldn't
		want to be distracted by many bright colors or too many distracting colors. I think
		the blue palette I chose would be a good fit.

2. An adjacent color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=50V0S0ketxL56T19KIWiZr+nto1
Your Rationale: The color palette I chose for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago 
		Botanical Garden is a good fit. This is because the colors fit the season
		and occasion. The colors in this palette are a light orange color, light yellow, 
		and a light red. These are considered to be "spring colors", as they are warm,
		light, and similar to the colors of blooming plants / flowers. This color
		palette is a good match for spring botanical events.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=35k0S0ketxL56T19KIWiZr+nto1
Your Rationale: I chose this triadic color palette because the colors are bright / warm pastel colors
		that are similar to many ads / games used for children. The colors are a dark pink, 
		bright yellow, and a slightly dark blue color. These are common colors used for
		things related to children, as they are warm, welcoming, and fun. For the use of
		making a login page for a kids app, I believe this palette is a good choice.

4. A custom color palette for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=b5t3-480k2zf280pA25kv3l8R994F
Your Rationale: I chose this palette for advertising a cybersecurity course because it is sleek,
		minimalistic, and has a darker / more metallic look. Someone looking at an ad
		for something cybersecurity related would not expect to see bright pastel colors
		or a wide array of bright colors; they would likely expect to see variations of
		grays, blacks, white, and perhaps cold blue based grays. This palette includes
		a neutral gray, a dark blue gray, and pale red, and other variations of gray.
		I believe this color palette is a reasonable choice for a cybersecurity 
		related ad.
